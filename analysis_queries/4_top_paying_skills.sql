    Here is a condensed, executive-level summary in 3 bullets, preserving the core insight:

    - High pay reflects hybrid roles, not traditional analytics:
      These salaries correspond to analytics engineers, ML/AI engineers, 
      and infra-aware analysts. Compensation is driven by engineering scarcity 
      and business criticality, not BI or dashboarding.

    - Infrastructure, deployment, and production ML command premiums:
      Skills in data pipelines, DevOps, distributed systems, and production ML 
      (e.g. Airflow, Kafka, Terraform, ML platforms) are paid highly because they 
      sit close to revenue-critical systems.

    - Low-supply, high-impact skills drive outliers:
      Languages, platforms, and even legacy tools earn high pay when they are rare 
      and mission-critical, especially in finance, big tech, and trading environments.
