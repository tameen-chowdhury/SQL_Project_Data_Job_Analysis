# Background 
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

Data hails from my [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here’s how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs

To identify the highest-paying roles I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    j.job_id,
    j.job_title,
    j.job_location,
    j.job_schedule_type,
    j.salary_year_avg,
    j.job_posted_date::DATE,
    c.name AS company_name
FROM 
    job_postings_fact j
LEFT JOIN company_dim c ON j.company_id = c.company_id
WHERE
    j.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    j.job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    j.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    j.salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.
